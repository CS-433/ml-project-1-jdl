# CS-433 - Project 1

## TO DO
<ul>
    <li>report</li>
    <li>run.py file</li>
    <li>feature investigation if we have time</li>
    <li>compare models and the best</li>
    <li>anticipate which results we should have and if what we get seems consistent</li>
    <li>comment code</li>
</ul>

## Exploratory data analysis
<ul>
    <li>shape</li>
    <li>type</li>
    <li>first and last values of rows/columns</li>
    <li>check for missing values</li>
    <li>deal with missing values (suppression-subsitution-interpolation_...)</li>
    <li>check for outliers (?)</li>
    <li>feature engineering (standardization etc)</li>
    <li>Pattern in data
        <ul>
            <li>univariate analysis (histogram). And we know that : 'Low variance features tend to contribute less to the prediction of outcome variable'.</li>
            <li>correlation analysis (between features) using heatmaps -> we should eliminate correlated features (one feature from a correlated pair is dropped)</li>
            <li>bivariate analysis. And we know that : ' If the relative variability is large, then it may be an indication of that these features could contribute to predicting the labels. '</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>feature selection : filter methods or wrapper methods?</li>
</ul>
